This is a project to create a web application in object-oriented
MVC style using PHP with a MySQL database without using any of the
developed frameworks out there.

It is a web application that can be used by reporter(s) to post
news articles after authentication and for ordinary users to 
read news articles and comment on them.

Still in development.
